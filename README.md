This repo contains material for our submitted peerJ paper

The keywords used to crawl and retrieve the employed datasets can be found in the _keywords_ folder. With regard to the US elections dataset, unfortunately, the keywords were selected by experts (journalists) during the REVEAL project and are part of proprietary material. As such, they cannot be provided.

The retrieved Tweet IDs can be found in the _tweetIDs_ folder.

In order to extract the desired dataset, a python (v3+) script has been provided within the  _tweetIDs_ folder. It only requires the decompression of the desired dataset(s) (e.g. _sherlockTweetIDs.rar_).
